## Welcome to the Sendazi API

The **Sendazi API** enables developers to programmatically send **SMS and Voice campaigns**, manage contacts and groups, configure sender IDs, and monitor usage and billing.

It is designed for reliable, high-volume messaging use cases, including:

- Marketing and bulk messaging platforms  
- Transactional and notification systems  
- CRM and ERP integrations  
- Custom communication workflows  

The API follows standard REST principles and uses JSON for all requests and responses.

## Base URL

All API requests are made against the following base URL:

```http
https://api.sendazi.com/api/v1
```

## Authentication

All Sendazi API endpoints require Bearer Token authentication.
Include your API token in the Authorization header for every request:

```Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```
Authentication is enforced globally across all endpoints.

🔐 API tokens grant full access to your account. Store them securely and never expose them in client-side applications.
