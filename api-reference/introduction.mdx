## Welcome to the Sendazi API

The **Sendazi API** allows developers to send **SMS and Voice campaigns**, manage contacts and groups, configure sender IDs, and track billing — all programmatically.

The API is designed for:
- Marketing and bulk messaging platforms
- Transactional notifications
- CRM and ERP integrations
- Custom messaging workflows

Sendazi API documentation is powered by an **OpenAPI 3.1 specification**, which enables an interactive API playground and up-to-date endpoint references.
